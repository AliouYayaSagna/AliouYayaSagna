 Hi there 👋, I am Aliou Yaya SAGNA, a young senegalese still studying, enthusiast about theorical science, computer science, electronic, robotic,...so on, in a nutshell about whatever touching science et technologie.
	
_I am currently working to join an engineering school in computer science, but in the other side I am an autodidact, I learned python, javascript, htlm...and a bit about arduino and still reaching to improve those skills and future others.

_I am looking to become an AI specialist, to be behind the mathematic and computationnal structure of the models.

_I am open for anyone who whould help me by advice, experience feedback or whatever else.

_My project: help for a thecnological transition in Africa thanks to AI
